# Discord Bot Project

## Overview
This project is a simple Discord bot that responds to user messages. It uses the Discord API and a custom response function to interact with users in both public channels and private messages.

## Project Structure
1. **Loading the Token**: The bot token is loaded from an environment file (`.env`) to keep it secure.
2. **Bot Initialization**: The bot is initialized with specific intents to read message content.
3. **Message Handling**: The bot can send messages in response to user input, either publicly in the channel or privately if the message starts with a specific character.
4. **Bot Startup**: The bot announces when it is ready and running.
5. **Incoming Message Processing**: The bot listens for new messages, processes them, and sends appropriate responses.

## Key Features
- **Environment Variables**: Securely loads the Discord bot token from an environment file.
- **Intents Configuration**: Properly sets up the bot to read message content.
- **Private Messaging**: Responds to private messages if the user message starts with a specific character (`?`).
- **Error Handling**: Catches and prints any exceptions that occur during message processing.
- **Logging**: Logs user messages and the channels they come from for debugging and monitoring purposes.

## Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries (`discord.py` and `python-dotenv`) installed.
2. **Setup Environment**: Create a `.env` file with your Discord bot token.
3. **Run the Bot**: Execute the main script to start the bot.

## Future Improvements
- Add more sophisticated response logic.
- Implement additional features like commands, user management, and more.
- Enhance error handling and logging mechanisms.
